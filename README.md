# Object-Detection-Project
Our project is focused on making the world safer using artificial intelligence (AI). Our main goal is to stop fights and conflicts before they start.

Imagine this: when people argue, it can sometimes lead to bigger problems. What if we could spot these arguments early and calm things down right away? That's what our project aims to do.

We are building a smart system that detects when people have weapons like guns, knives, or bombs. When it sees a problem, it sends alerts to security officers to help cool things down.

One of the best parts of our system is that it works immediately. This means no one has to spend hours watching camera recordings. We're saving time and effort, making sure help is there when it's needed most.

While our system is smart, it's not perfect. We can't promise it will catch everything 100% of the time. But we do promise it will be a helpful tool that saves time and prevents big problems before they happen. It's like having a watchful guardian that's always on duty.

We're doing this because we believe everyone should feel safe where they live, work, and play. By stopping fights before they grow, we can prevent harm and keep the peace.

For technology, we use OpenCV, YOLOv8, Google Colab, .NET, Angular, PostgreSQL, and Firebase.

In short, our project is like a helpful friend who's always there to step in and stop fights before they become serious.
